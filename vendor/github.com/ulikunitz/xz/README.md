# Package xz

This Go language package will enable reading and writing of
xz-compressed files and streams. The complete package will be written in
Go and will not use any existing C library.

The package is currently under development. Don't expect the code to
work for you or the APIs to be stable.

# Status

Package xz/lzma has now working support for "classic" lzma files. A
lzmago binary supporting the typical flags for a UNIX compression
command is provided.

To test it call the following command.

    $ lzmago bigfile

After some time a much smaller file bigfile.lzma will replace bigfile.
To decompress it use the following command.

    $ lzmago -d bigfile.lzma

Be warned at this time the code cannot compete with the lzma binary from
the xz tools. The algorithms in those tools have been developed over a
long time and are highly optimized. But the lzmago tool happily
decompresses files generated by lzma and lzma has no problems with files
created by lzmago.
